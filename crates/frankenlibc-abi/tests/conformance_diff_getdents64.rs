/// This gate's host arm was two LINK-TIME references: the raw syscall entry and
/// the errno accessor. fl defines both under
/// `#[cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), unsafe(no_mangle))]`. Confirmed on the
/// built artifact rather than assumed: `nm -D --defined-only` on a release
/// `libfrankenlibc_abi.so` lists `T __errno_location` and `T syscall` and lists
/// neither as undefined, so in a RELEASE test binary the linker prefers fl's
/// definitions and this "host" arm would call fl's own syscall wrapper and read
/// fl's errno slot — the gate comparing fl against itself and passing
/// unconditionally. Debug keeps the symbols mangled, which is why it has been
/// honest in the profile CI runs.
///
/// A collapsed SYSCALL arm cannot be caught by running the gate: unlike the
/// errno collapse, which made three gates fail `--release` with the host arm
/// reading errno 0 (bd-g1sjty), fl-vs-fl simply passes. `host_addr` aborts when
/// the resolved address equals fl's own definition, which is the only thing that
/// distinguishes it. See bd-0q7ba9.
